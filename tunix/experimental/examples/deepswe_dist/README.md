# Distributed DeepSWE GRPO Pipeline

This example ports the non-experimental `examples/deepswe` recipe to the
experimental distributed RL control plane. It reuses the recipe's
`examples/deepswe/deepswe_data.py`, `examples/deepswe/swe_agent.py`, and
`examples/deepswe/swe_env.py` directly; only the distributed registry and
request wiring, orchestration, and launchers live in this directory.

1. `run_deepswe_dist.py` runs the CPU orchestrator.
2. `../common/run_rollout_node.py` runs a rollout worker configured with the
   original recipe's `swe_env.SWEEnv` and `swe_agent.SWEAgent` implementations.
3. The trainer worker is reused from `../common/run_trainer_node.py` because it
   is already a generic PeftTrainer V2 worker.

The first milestone is intentionally small: run one trainer+rollout pipeline
step with `BETA=0.0` and `WEIGHT_SYNC_MODE=none`. The default path uses the
regular DeepSWE `SWEEnv` backend. Set `USE_AGENT_SANDBOX=1` to construct
`SWEEnv` with `SandboxFleet` inside the rollout worker process.

```bash
cd tunix/experimental/examples/deepswe_dist
BETA=0.0 WEIGHT_SYNC_MODE=none MAX_STEPS=1 BATCH_SIZE=1 NUM_GENERATIONS=2 ./launcher.sh
```

```bash
cd tunix/experimental/examples/deepswe_dist
USE_AGENT_SANDBOX=1 BETA=0.0 WEIGHT_SYNC_MODE=none MAX_STEPS=1 BATCH_SIZE=1 NUM_GENERATIONS=2 ./launcher.sh
```

For sandbox placement, set `SANDBOX_NAMESPACE`, `SANDBOX_NODE_SELECTOR_KEY`, and
`SANDBOX_NODE_SELECTOR_VAL` before launching. The launcher forwards them to the
rollout worker as the `agent_sandbox_rl` variables consumed by `SWEEnv`.

To deploy on Kubernetes / GKE:

```bash
cd tunix/experimental/examples/deepswe_dist
./k8s_launcher.sh --command start
```

Or run with sandbox enabled on GKE:

```bash
cd tunix/experimental/examples/deepswe_dist
USE_AGENT_SANDBOX=1 ./k8s_launcher.sh --command start
```

To stop all jobsets:

```bash
./k8s_launcher.sh --command stop
```
